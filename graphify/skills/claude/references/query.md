# graphify reference: query, path, explain

Load this when the user asks a question against an existing graph, or runs `/graphify path` or `/graphify explain`. The core's query stub points here for the full traversal flow. These flows use the `graphify query` CLI when it is available and fall back to an inline NetworkX traversal otherwise.

Two traversal modes - choose based on the question:

| Mode | Flag | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| BFS (default) | _(none)_ | "What is X connected to?" - broad context, nearest neighbors first |
| DFS | `--dfs` | "How does X reach Y?" - trace a specific chain or dependency path |

First check the graph exists:
```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
from pathlib import Path
if not Path('graphify-out/graph.json').exists():
    print('ERROR: No graph found. Run /graphify <path> first to build the graph.')
    raise SystemExit(1)
"
```
If it fails, stop and tell the user to run `/graphify <path>` first.

### Step 0 — Bounded evidence fast path

Run one deterministic query with the user's original wording:

```bash
graphify query "ORIGINAL_QUESTION" --format evidence-json --max-nodes 80 --budget 1000
```

The response is a compact evidence packet with a traversal profile, hard node budget, provenance, and an `llm.mode` admission decision:

- `none`: the graph contains a direct grounded lookup. Answer from the packet and make no further graph or LLM-assisted discovery calls.
- `synthesize`: the bounded packet contains connected evidence. Produce one grounded answer from it; do not expand or traverse again unless a specific evidence gap is visible.
- `reason`: evidence is missing, disconnected, ambiguous, or capped. If `coverage.truncated` is true, run a narrower follow-up query naming the most relevant seed and relationship; do not answer yet. Use constrained vocabulary expansion only when the packet was not capped and the failure indicates a wording mismatch.

For every answer, cite `source_location` and describe uncertainty instead of inventing an edge. If a document node includes a `content` pointer, fetch only that line range with MCP `get_document_section` when available. Otherwise read only `source_file` from `start_line` through `end_line`, and verify `content_ref` before trusting cached coordinates. Never load the whole document merely because a section matched.

### Step 1 — Constrained query expansion (recovery only)

Use this only when the fast path returns `reason`, `coverage.truncated` is false, and the evidence indicates a vocabulary mismatch. Graphify's matcher is deliberately deterministic, so cross-language wording or a domain alias can miss the graph's labels. Extract label vocabulary, then select at most 12 semantically relevant tokens that actually occur in it:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
import json, re
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/graph.json').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
vocab = set()
for node in data['nodes']:
    for chunk in re.findall(r'[^\W\d_]+', node.get('label', '') or '', re.UNICODE):
        for part in re.findall(r'[A-Z]+(?=[A-Z][a-z])|[A-Z]?[a-z]+|[A-Z]+', chunk) or [chunk]:
            token = part.lower()
            if 3 <= len(token) <= 30:
                vocab.add(token)
Path('graphify-out/.vocab.txt').write_text('\n'.join(sorted(vocab)), encoding='utf-8')
print(f'vocab: {len(vocab)} tokens')
"
```

Only choose tokens present in `.vocab.txt`; skip concepts with no plausible match. Print `Query expanded to (from graph vocab, N tokens): [...]` for auditability. If none match, stop and report that the graph lacks relevant vocabulary. Otherwise run one recovery query:

```bash
graphify query "EXPANDED_QUERY" --format evidence-json --max-nodes 80 --budget 1000
```

If the CLI is unavailable, load `graphify-out/graph.json` with NetworkX, select at most three label-matching seeds, and traverse at most 80 nodes to depth 3. Prefer `calls`, event/data-flow, and reference edges over containment or import structure. Return only node labels, relations, confidence, and source locations within the 2,000-token budget. This fallback must remain bounded and must not invoke an LLM.

After writing the answer, save it back into the graph so it improves future queries. When recovery was used, include the selected tokens in the answer so the next update retains the expansion history:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "ORIGINAL_QUESTION" --answer "ANSWER" --type query --nodes NODE1 NODE2
```

Replace `ORIGINAL_QUESTION` with the user's verbatim question, `ANSWER` with the grounded answer, and `NODE1 NODE2` with cited node labels. This closes the feedback loop: the next `--update` will extract this Q&A as a node in the graph.

**Work memory (self-improving loop).** Add an `--outcome` so future sessions learn from this one — append `--outcome useful|dead_end|corrected` to the `save-result` command (and `--correction "the right answer"` when correcting):

- `useful` — the cited nodes answered the question well (they become *preferred sources*).
- `dead_end` — the question/path led nowhere; don't re-derive it next time.
- `corrected` — the saved answer was wrong; `--correction` records what was right.

At the **start** of graph work, refresh and read the lessons: run `graphify reflect --if-stale` (cheap, deterministic, no LLM; `--if-stale` makes it a no-op when `LESSONS.md` is already newer than every input, e.g. when the git hook just refreshed it), then read `graphify-out/reflections/LESSONS.md`. It lists **preferred sources** (start there), **known dead ends** (skip them), and prior **corrections**. Running `reflect` yourself keeps the lessons current even without the git hook installed; if the post-commit hook *is* installed, `--if-stale` means your session-start run costs almost nothing.

## For /graphify path

Find the shortest path between two named concepts in the graph. Prefer the CLI when installed:

```bash
graphify path "NODE_A" "NODE_B"
```

If the CLI is unavailable, run it inline:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
import json, sys
import networkx as nx
from networkx.readwrite import json_graph
from pathlib import Path

data = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/graph.json').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
G = json_graph.node_link_graph(data, edges='links')

a_term = 'NODE_A'
b_term = 'NODE_B'

def find_node(term):
    term = term.lower()
    scored = sorted(
        [(sum(1 for w in term.split() if w in G.nodes[n].get('label','').lower()), n)
         for n in G.nodes()],
        reverse=True
    )
    return scored[0][1] if scored and scored[0][0] > 0 else None

src = find_node(a_term)
tgt = find_node(b_term)

if not src or not tgt:
    print(f'Could not find nodes matching: {a_term!r} or {b_term!r}')
    sys.exit(0)

try:
    path = nx.shortest_path(G, src, tgt)
    print(f'Shortest path ({len(path)-1} hops):')
    for i, nid in enumerate(path):
        label = G.nodes[nid].get('label', nid)
        if i < len(path) - 1:
            _raw = G[nid][path[i+1]]; edge = next(iter(_raw.values()), {}) if isinstance(G, nx.MultiGraph) else _raw
            rel = edge.get('relation', '')
            conf = edge.get('confidence', '')
            print(f'  {label} --{rel}--> [{conf}]')
        else:
            print(f'  {label}')
except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
    print(f'No path found between {a_term!r} and {b_term!r}')
except nx.NodeNotFound as e:
    print(f'Node not found: {e}')
"
```

Replace `NODE_A` and `NODE_B` with the actual concept names from the user. Then explain the path in plain language - what each hop means, why it's significant.

After writing the explanation, save it back:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "Path from NODE_A to NODE_B" --answer "ANSWER" --type path_query --nodes NODE_A NODE_B
```

---

## For /graphify explain

Give a plain-language explanation of a single node - everything connected to it. Prefer the CLI when installed:

```bash
graphify explain "NODE_NAME"
```

If the CLI is unavailable, run it inline:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
import json, sys
import networkx as nx
from networkx.readwrite import json_graph
from pathlib import Path

data = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/graph.json').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
G = json_graph.node_link_graph(data, edges='links')

term = 'NODE_NAME'
term_lower = term.lower()

# Find best matching node
scored = sorted(
    [(sum(1 for w in term_lower.split() if w in G.nodes[n].get('label','').lower()), n)
     for n in G.nodes()],
    reverse=True
)
if not scored or scored[0][0] == 0:
    print(f'No node matching {term!r}')
    sys.exit(0)

nid = scored[0][1]
data_n = G.nodes[nid]
print(f'NODE: {data_n.get(\"label\", nid)}')
print(f'  source: {data_n.get(\"source_file\",\"unknown\")}')
print(f'  type: {data_n.get(\"file_type\",\"unknown\")}')
print(f'  degree: {G.degree(nid)}')
print()
print('CONNECTIONS:')
for neighbor in G.neighbors(nid):
    _raw = G[nid][neighbor]; edge = next(iter(_raw.values()), {}) if isinstance(G, nx.MultiGraph) else _raw
    nlabel = G.nodes[neighbor].get('label', neighbor)
    rel = edge.get('relation', '')
    conf = edge.get('confidence', '')
    src_file = G.nodes[neighbor].get('source_file', '')
    print(f'  --{rel}--> {nlabel} [{conf}] ({src_file})')
"
```

Replace `NODE_NAME` with the concept the user asked about. Then write a 3-5 sentence explanation of what this node is, what it connects to, and why those connections are significant. Use the source locations as citations.

After writing the explanation, save it back:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "Explain NODE_NAME" --answer "ANSWER" --type explain --nodes NODE_NAME
```
