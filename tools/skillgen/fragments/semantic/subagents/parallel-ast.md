**Run Part A (AST) and Part B (semantic) in parallel. Dispatch all semantic subagents AND start AST extraction in the same message. Both can run simultaneously since they operate on different file types. Merge results in Part C as before.**

Note: Parallelizing AST + semantic saves 5-15s on large corpora. AST is deterministic and fast; start it while subagents are processing docs/papers.
