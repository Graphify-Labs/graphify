description: Consult the graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/ for codebase and architecture questions.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- For codebase or architecture questions, when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, first use the graph. Prefer the MCP `query_graph` tool when it is available; otherwise follow the installed Graphify skill's interpreter-based CLI fallback. Use `shortest_path` / `get_node` (or their module-invocation CLI equivalents) for relationships and focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than `GRAPH_REPORT.md` or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
